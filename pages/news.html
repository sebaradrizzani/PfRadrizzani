          <p>AGAINST is an Argentinian metal band formed in early 2009 by guitar players and lead singers Sebastián
            Radrizzani and Iván Monastirsky, drummer Gustavo Radrizzani and bass player Federico Gerván. Its sound
            combines powerful riffs with melodic choruses and duet guitar parts, creating a groovy sound with a mixture
            of melodic and aggressive singing.</p>
      
          
            <p>“SOY LIBERTAD” was presented in Uniclub (Buenos Aires), in front of hundreds of spectators. This way,
              AGAINST strengthened its position both in the local and national heavy metal scene. The album had such an
              excellent reception that the band carried on touring across the country in 2015, going back to small towns
              and cities they had already visited and playing in new locations.
              In January 2016, AGAINST recorded their second studio album: "EMERGER", a new record that denotes the
              band’s acquired experience and maturity.</p>


            <p>There was a very positive reception of second album by both the public and the specialized press, being
              reviewed by important magazines, blogs, and websites. Shortly after releasing EMERGER, the band went on
              a national tour once again adding new venues. On an international level, the tour takes them for the first time
              to the city of Asuncion, Paraguay and to Uruguay once again.
              In April 2017, the band participated in Wacken Metal Battle Argentina, an event held by Wacken Open Air
              and Radio Vorterix. After a first selection among more than 300 bands, AGAINST was chosen as a finalist
              along with seven other bands which, on June 1st competed LIVE in front of a jury conformed by national
              metal-music referents. In such final, AGAINST is crowned with the VICTORY, earning their place at WACKEN
              OPEN AIR, 2017 and becoming the only Argentinian band to have played in the biggest metal festival with
              the largest audience worldwide that year, and the third band to have done so in the history of our country. In
              this way, AGAINST made it possible to fulfill the dream of many people by giving Argentina a place in the
              mythical German festival.</p>
            

            <p>After having played with important international bands such as SEPULTURA (Brazil), JINJER (Ukraine), WARBRINGER
              (USA), CRIMINAL (Chile- UK) and EKTOMORF (Hungary), in December 2019, they won the contest "Rock&Pop
              Experience: open for Dream Theater" of radio Rock&Pop, which allowed them to play with DREAM THEATER (USA) and
              become the first heavy metal music band to perform at the new Movistar Arena stadium in Buenos Aires. By the end of
              the year, they once again travelled to Uruguay to play with Reytoro and reunite with their fans in the neighboring
              country.</p>

            <p>
              In February of 2020, they went on increasing their recognition in Latin America and had the pleasure of performing for
              the  rst time at the mythical Teatro Flores (Buenos Aires) together with MALÓN and A.N.I.M.A.L.
              At present, they are concentrating on the recording and imminent release of their fourth studio album, as well as their
              next live album, while they continue with frequent live performances, as their audience demands. During the summer
              months of 2023, they toured various parts of the country on a tour that took them to new cities, crowning them as
              guests of the legend Paul Di'Anno. On the near horizon, they are preparing to be part of Vorterix Metal accompanying
              Testament and Kreator, they will also be present before the Swedish Darkane and they are preparing to embark to
              Paraguay and Uruguay soon, before performing again at Teatro Flores. All of this shows once again the unstoppable
              and sustained growth that they have been able to achieve.
